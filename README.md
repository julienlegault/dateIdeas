# Date Ideas
Automatically generates date ideas based on selections.

Food Selection: Two checkboxes allow the user to select if they want exclusivly food dates, exclusivly not food dates, or both. By default both are selected. 

Outside Selection: Works the same as food, just with outdoor activities instead of eating. 

Price: Min price and Max price boxes allow for easy narrowing down of what date should be chosen.

The date is selected from a SQL database and pinpointed on google static maps.
